# Homework week 1

Using MySQL-client 
1. create a database **HR**
2. create a table employee
3. create a table locations
4. Insert 10-20 rows in each table with relevant fields. (Make sure that you have relevant relations)

Create a script file or MySQL-dump of the database. 

Import the database **new_world** (using the new_world.sql-file), 
then query (using select statements) the **new_world** database to answer following questions
(Queries 6-10 should be answered using joins, group by and having clauses)

1. What are the names of countries with population greater than 8 million
2. What are the names of countries that have “land” in their names ?
3. What are the names of the cities with population in between 500,000 and 1 million ?
4. What's the name of all the countries on the continent ‘Europe’ ?
5. List all the countries in the descending order of their surface areas.
6. What are the names of all the cities in the Netherlands?
7. What is the population of Rotterdam ?
8. What's the top 10 countries by Surface Area ?
9. What's the top 10 most populated cities?
10. What is the population of the world ?


### Importing a MySQL-dump into an instance:
- in a console, change directory to the Week1 directory. Then type 
    mysql < new_world.sql
    (this requires that the path to the mysql-binary has been added to the users PATH-variable)
- in MySQL Workbench, do
    click "Server" -> "Data Import"
    choose "Import from self-contained file", and browse to the Week1/new_world.sql-file
    click "Start import"

Homework should be handed in by writing a node-JS program, that creates the database (step 1) and run the queries (step 2)
( or at least as a text-file with the sql-queries and results (either in one big file, or as separate files) )
